Netflix Data Analysis Dashboard
🎯 Project Motivation

Netflix is not just a streaming platform it’s a data-driven company. With thousands of movies and TV shows, I wanted to explore how Netflix’s content is distributed, what kind of ratings dominate, how content evolved over time, and which countries/genres are most influential.

I built this project to:

Strengthen my data analytics skills (data cleaning, transformation, visualization).

Demonstrate how data can tell a story about global entertainment trends.

Practice designing professional dashboards in Power BI.

This project is a blend of curiosity + analytics—turning raw data into actionable insights.

📂 Dataset & Preparation

The dataset used was Netflix Titles Dataset (netflix_titles.csv) containing 8,809 titles with attributes like:

Type (Movie/TV Show)

Title, Director, Cast

Country of origin

Release Year & Date Added

Rating (TV-MA, PG, R, etc.)

Duration (minutes/seasons)

Genres (listed_in)

Steps I performed:

Imported dataset into Power BI.

Cleaned data (handled nulls, standardized date formats).

Created calculated fields where needed (e.g., separating Movies vs TV Shows).

Built visualizations and combined them into an interactive dashboard.

📊 Analysis & Key Findings

🔹 Total Content: 8,809 titles

Movies: 6,131 (69.62%)

TV Shows: 2,676 (30.38%)

🔹 Content Ratings

Most content is rated TV-MA and TV-14, showing Netflix caters largely to mature and young-adult audiences.

Family-oriented ratings (TV-PG, PG-13) are fewer, highlighting Netflix’s primary demographic.

🔹 Trends Over the Years

Titles added surged after 2015, matching Netflix’s global expansion strategy.

Older titles (2000–2010) are mostly movies, while newer additions lean towards TV Shows (original series).

🔹 Genres & Countries

USA and India lead in total titles.

Regional contributions from countries like the UK, South Korea, and Japan highlight cultural diversity.

Smaller countries also contribute unique genres.

🔹 Release Year Patterns

Strong dominance of movies released post-2000.

Shift in focus towards TV Originals after 2015.
